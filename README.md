Hey! :D

I am passionate about computer networks and algorithms. I also studied hardware design as well as software because I wanted to study everything in computer science.
Interestingly, my hobby is Motor Vehicles maintenance. I was interested in vehicles at high school and got a motor vehicles maintenance certificate. My dream is to research new technologies that combine vehicle and computer science.

All my projects are uploaded to github. If you have any questions, Please do not hesitate to contact me.
